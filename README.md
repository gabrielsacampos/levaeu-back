# LevaEu

As its core, LevaEu is a platform that connects people with establishments, providing families with a relaxing and funny day filled with good memories.
The project is currently in the initial phase of building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as part of the postgraduate Software Engineering sprint at PUC-RJ.

The architecture of this project follows the MVC pattern, separating the frontend and backend into different repositories. You can check the frontend repository at this link [__comming soon__].
